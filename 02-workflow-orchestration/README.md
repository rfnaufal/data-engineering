# Workflow Orchestration

In the previous module, I learned how to use Docker and docker-compose to build containerized data pipelines with PostgreSQL, networking, and persistent storage.

In this module, we will start developing the workflow orchestration using Kestra.  
We will reuse the existing `docker-compose.yaml` with some adjustments to support Kestra.
